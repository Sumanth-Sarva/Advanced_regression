# Advance Regression - Assignment Part-I
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
> We need to model using ridge and lasso and find the requisites


## Steps:
* Reading and understanding the data
* Data Cleaning
* EDA
* Data Preparation for modelling
* Train-Test Split
* Building the Model
* Lasso
* Ridge+RFE
* Observation
* Conclusion


## Problem Statement: 
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
The company wants to know:
  Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
  How well those variables describe the price of a house.. 


## Conclusion of our model:
The optimal lambda value in case of Ridge and Lasso is as below:
Ridge - 100
Lasso - 0.01

The Mean Squared error in case of Ridge and Lasso are:
Ridge - 0.1122
Lasso - 0.1025

Best Train and Test Scores in our models:
Lasso Model: Î±=0.01
Train R2 Score: 93
Test R2 Score: 90
